# News challenge

## Introduction

Weekend challenge for the conclusion of week 7 at Makers Academy. The task was to create a single page newsreader web app. 

## Project overview

This app grabs all the headlines from the [Guardian's Open Platform API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) and displays them on a page. Clicking on an image will provide an overlay with a news summary generated by the [Pegasus Newsroom API](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-newsroom) which also then provides a link to the original story on the Guardian website. Clicking on the headline will also link the user to the original story.

- [x] A 'standfirst' summary of each article is shown alongside each story
- [x] Rolling over a story with the mouse cursor will trigger a zoom animation
- [x] Clicking on an image will provide an AI generated news summary in an overlay
- [x] Clicking a news article title links to the original article
- [x] Users can specify a search query on the page and get articles matching this search
- [x] Webpage is fully responsive and scales to screen size

## Test Coverage

## Issues

The AI generated news summary feature was a last-minute addition. Given the short window for development, this meant that implementation was not as efficient as it could have been. Summaries can be slow to load and temperamental if the user clicks a lot of images, and the overlays are not responsive in the same way as the main website. If redoing this challenge from scratch I would prefer to implement this functionality at the very start alongside the Guardian API. so that it could be more efficiently integrated.
